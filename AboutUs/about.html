            <p>“Looking for Group” (LFG) is a term used in gaming communities to signify that a player is looking for a team or group of players to play with. 
                The term is also used to title chat channels that focus on helping players find those groups. The PartyPal is seeking to solve the problems 
                that can arise in some common competitive games such Tom Clancy’s Rainbow 6: Siege, Apex Legends, Counter Strike 2, Valorant, and Call of Duty.
